Welcome to the **BroFOSS**- An initiative of Open Source Technologies using Computer Science, Electrical and Electronics concepts!

We are going to apply for the first time to Google Summer of Code 2018. Below are some list of ideas for students to apply for, but not limited to it. We are open to new ideas, feel free to discuss them in our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brofoss).

## Potential Mentors
* Anupam Das ([opticod](https://github.com/opticod)) (anupam.das.bwn@gmail.com)
* Arnab Kumar Das ([arnabdasbwn](https://github.com/arnabdasbwn)) (arnab.das.bwn@gmail.com)

We are also open to new potential mentors, who wants to join us.

## Potential Ideas
### 1. Safe Navigator (IOT + Android)

**Idea:**

In many places including cities in India, people face road accidents in winter due to poor visibility from fog. Our idea is to build, a navigation based app which will alert and suggest the users on the road to stop / reduce their speed of their vehicle, when there is sudden congestion in front of them, using p2p based techniques. At the same time privacy of all users should also be taken care. 

**Technologies:** 

Android Development, Google Map API / Mapbox API, Google Cloud Platform / Any other scalable server approach.

### 2. E-voting (Cryptography + Web)

**Idea:**

In many institutions, we still use manual based voting system, where an user  is required to go to an place and write his/ her vote in a paper, and then submit in a box. After few weeks, the results are declared using manual counting. Our idea to create an open source, secure, e-voting system, which can be used by such different institutions to automate their processes. 

**Technologies:**

Web Development, Cryptography.

### 3. E-voting (Cryptography + Android)

**Idea:**

**(Android mobile version of Idea 3)**

In many institutions, we still use manual based voting system, where an user  is required to go to an place and write his/ her vote in a paper, and then submit in a box. After few weeks, the results are declared using manual counting. Our idea to create an open source, secure, e-voting system, which can be used by such different institutions to automate their processes. 

**Technologies:**

Android Development, Cryptography.

### 4. Moto Navigator (IOT + Android)

**Idea:**

(Existing open source android app repo: https://github.com/BroFOSS/Moto-Navigator)

Create an Arduino/ Raspberry Pi/ BeagleBone based system, which will automate the lightnings of any motor vehicle. Once the system is paired with the android app, it will send different signals using bluetooth/ wifi, to the system to turn various lightings on, depending on its location, road orientation, and heading direction.

**Technologies:**

Arduino/ Raspberry Pi/ BeagleBone, Android Development.
